## Expected-Value-Shortest-Interval

This repo contains a creative proof with code simulation of the expected length of the smallest interval among n + 1 intervals formed by randomly selecting n points from the [0, 1] line segment

# Python script

This script simulates the random experiment according to custom parameters and plots and records the result. Run the script as below

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python script.py
```

# Visualiser

Code for the visualiser is in the `visualiser` folder
It consists of a simple html file using the canvas api to visualize the experiment
